# Heading: Sustainable Urban Gardening — Growing Green in Small Spaces

## Introduction
Sustainable urban gardening lets city-dwellers grow food and green space in apartments, balconies, and tiny plots. It combines smart space use, water-conscious techniques, and community-minded practices to reduce food miles and boost well-being. In this article we explore practical methods, benefits, and tips for starting a productive urban garden.

## Container Gardening: Get Growing in Pots [1]
Container gardening uses pots, grow bags, or planters to grow vegetables and herbs. Choose deep containers for root crops and ensure drainage. Use high-quality potting mix and consider companion planting to maximize productivity. [1]

## Vertical Gardening: Expand Upwards [2]
When horizontal space is limited, vertical systems like trellises, hanging planters, and pallet gardens make use of walls and railings. Select climbing varieties (peas, beans, cucumbers) and lightweight planters to avoid structural strain. [2]

## Water-wise Techniques: Save Every Drop [3]
Using drip irrigation, mulching, and rainwater harvesting greatly reduces water use. Mulch prevents evaporation and maintains soil structure, while drip lines deliver water to roots where it's needed most. [3]

## Community Gardens & Social Benefits [4]
Community gardens not only increase local food production but also foster social ties and provide educational opportunities. They can transform vacant lots into productive green spaces and improve neighborhood aesthetics. [4]

## Summary
- Urban gardening is scalable — anyone can start with a single pot.
- Vertical and container systems make the most of limited space.
- Water-wise practices reduce resource use and improve yields.
- Community gardens offer social and environmental benefits.
